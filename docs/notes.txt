should it save at create list?

anon users should get the most recent result saved in localstorage, as well as recent list

the url is created and the list gets saved in localstorage.
  if anon user then logs in or creates account, then the recent list and/or result should be saved automatically

so, all users will store their most recent list and most recent result

the list gets saved in its own collection

the result gets saved on the user object

home screen is always most recent list only (plus the new list sign)

so, next steps at this point:

after completing the war, does it just redirect to the homescreen?

perhaps, with a congratulatory message, with an animation?

nah, it is it's own result, the homescreen should just show a thumbnail with top 3.

so next step,
1. in create screen, create the list in db if user is logged in.
2. once this list is set, it doesn't get updated. It is merely referenced by id. Users can remove it.
   It should be deleted if the last user who has a reference to it has deleted it.
